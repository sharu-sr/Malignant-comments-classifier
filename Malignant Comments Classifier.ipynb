The label can be either 0 or 1, where 0 denotes a NO while 1 denotes a YES. There are various comments which have multiple labels. The first attribute is a unique ID associated with each comment.\n",

    "3)Rude: It denotes comments that are very rude and offensive.\n",
    "4)Threat: It contains indication of the comments that are giving any threat to someone.\n",

Since the data set is huge and includes many categories of comments, we can do good amount of data exploration and derive some interesting features using the comments text column available. You need to build a model that can differentiate between comments and its categories."
